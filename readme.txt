%% This code can realize the Iteratively Re-Weighted Minimization super-resolution  by GCV(general cross validation) and the adaptive regularization parameter tuning algorithm.

%% The 1st vision of Matlab code is from the paper "T. KÃ¶hler, X. Huang, F. Schebesch, A. Aichert, A. K. Maier, and J. Hornegger, "Robust Multiframe Super-Resolution Employing Iteratively Re-Weighted Minimization,
" IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging 2, 42-58 (2016)."  and modified by the author Feng Yang using ARPT method.
