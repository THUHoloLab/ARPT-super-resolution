function G = iat_image_jacobian(gx, gy, jac, nop)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% G = IAT_IMAGE_JACOBIAN(IX, IY, JAC, NOP)
% IAT_IMAGE_JACOBIAN computes the jacobian G of the warped image with 
% respect to transformation parameters. 
% This matrix depends on the gradient of the warped image, as 
% well as on the jacobian JAC of the warp transform wrt parameters. 
%
% For a detailed definition of matrix G, see [1]
%
% -->Input:
% IX:                   The warped image gradient in x (horizontal) direction
% IY:                   The warped image gradient in y (vertical) direction
% JAC:                  The jacobian matrix J of the warp transform with 
%                       respect to parameters. The size of JAC is MxN, 
%                       where N = NOP*size(IX,2) and M = size(IX,1)
% NOP:                  The number of warp parameters:
%                       homography: 8, 
%                       affine: 6, 
%                       euclidean: 3,
%                       translation: 2
%
% -->Output:
% G:                    The jacobian matrix G.
% 
% This function is used by ECC and Lucas-Kanade algorithms. Use this 
% function carefully out of this framework
